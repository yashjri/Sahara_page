                <h1>Sahara</h1>
                <p>The Sahara covers large parts of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger,
                    Western Sahara, Sudan and Tunisia. It covers 9 million square kilometres (3,500,000 sq mi),
                    amounting to 31% of Africa. If all areas with a mean annual precipitation of less than 250 mm were
                    included, the Sahara would be 11 million square kilometres (4,200,000 sq mi). It is one of three
                    distinct physiographic provinces of the African massive physiographic division. Sahara is so large
                    and bright that, in theory, it could be detected from other stars as a surface feature of Earth,
                    with near-current technology.</p>
